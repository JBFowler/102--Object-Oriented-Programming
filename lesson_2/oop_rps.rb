# Rock, Paper, Scissors is a two-player game where each player chooses one of three possible moves: rock, paper, or scissors. The chosen moves will then be compared to see who wins, according to the following rules:

# - rock beats scissors
# - scissors beats paper
# - paper beats rock

# If the players chose the same move, then it's a tie.

# Nouns: player, move, rule
# Verbs: choose, compare

# Player
#  - choose
# Move
# Rule

# - compare

# Answer to questions from refactoring 1

# Is this design, with Human and Computer sub-classes, better? Why, or why not?
# This design is better, it is much cleaner and allows the superclass to only have methods available to both classes, and the subclasses to have their methods to themselves.

# What is the primary improvement of this new design?
# The primary improvement is allowing the subclasses to have only the functionality they need.

# What is the primary drawback of this new design?
# The primary drawback is adding additional classes, which may add to the complexity of the program at first look, but after understanding what is going on, it actually simplifies it.

# Answer to questions from refactoring 2

# What is the primary improvement of this new design?
# The primary improvement is cleaning up the code by allowing the move to be an object and determing the winner in a seperate class from the PRSGame class.

# What is the primary drawback of this new design?
# The primary drawback is that it adds a fair amount of complexity to the program.
